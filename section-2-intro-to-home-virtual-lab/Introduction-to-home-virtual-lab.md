## Intro to Virtual Lab Environments
- ## Why Build a Home Cybersecurity Lab
- Essential for advancing cybersecurity
- Provides a safe, isolated environment for experimentation
- Avoids risk to real-world systems while learning

## Hands-on Learning in a Controlled Space.
- Practice using real tools like
    - SIEM systems
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Simulate attacks and response safely
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge with real-world application

## Bridge the knowledge Gap
- Transform passive learning into active, applied experience.
- Helps you understand:
    - How cyber tools behave in real-time
    - The workflows of real-world SOS operations

## Stay Ahead in a Rapidly Evolving Field
- Cybersecurity is constantly changing
- A home lab allows for:
    - Conrinuous self-driven learning
    = Testing and mastering new technologies as they emerge. 

## Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors: What's the difference?
- Type 1 hypervisor (bare-metal) runs directly on the hardware.
- Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing OS
- Key difference: performance, resource control, and scalability.


## Benefits of a Type 1 Hypervisor (eg Proxmox).
- Direct access to hardware = better performance and stability 
- Ideal for professional-grade home labs
- Features include:
    - VM and container management
    - Flexible networking and storage options
    - Snapshotting, backups, clustering

## When to use a Type 2 Hypervisor ( eg Virtualbox)
- Easier to install and use, especially for beginners
- Run inside a host OS (eg Windows or macOS)
- Great for: 
    - Quick setups
    - Laptops or limited-resource systems
- May experience higher overhead compared to Type1 hypervisor 

## Choosing the Right Hypervisor
- Type 1 is ideal if you want:
    - Higher efficiency
    - More advanced lap setups 
- Type 2 works well if you:
    - Are just getting started
    have fewer hardware resources
- Choice depends on your goals and system capabilities
## Install Virtualbox
- Make sure that virtualization enabled
- How? Control+Shift and Escape
